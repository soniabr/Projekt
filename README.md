> * Project Title: Residential Segregation in Zurich

## General Introduction

The segregation of people in living areas of cities is a well known phenomena which was investigated strongly for the case of blacks and whites living in the US. Because we are living in Zürich we would like to find out more about the social situation here. Zürich is a multi cultural city, many people from different origins and social backgrounds are living here. Thats why we would like to find out what makes people choose the part they live in. The combination of circumstances of people and the characteristics of places makes it a complex problem. In order to investigate this interactions, we will create a general model based on the data of Zürich that takes both into account, the peoples history and the properties of the place. 

## The Model

Based on statistical data of Zürich we want to implement a model which takes into account the origin and social status of the people as well as the available living options. We plan to use an agent based model. Each agent will have an origin and a social status. The city will be a grid of different locations which have different characteristics such as housing prices or how they are connected to public institutions. Taking into account the characteristics of a place and the social status of their neighbors the agents have to decide whether they will stay or move to a next place. 

## Fundamental Questions

What makes people choose their place to live? Is it the social environment? Or is it given by the characteristics of the location? How do these factors interact? And based on statistical data we will try to verify if the model reproduces reality. 

## Expected Results

We expect it to be an interaction of social environment and characteristics of the location. For some people the location will set their place to live because they don't have the possibilities to go to another place. Others can choose the place freely because they have the means and will choose due to the social environment.
